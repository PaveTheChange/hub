# Million Dreams

This space is designed to help you discover others who care about the things you care about, and to be quietly recognised for how you show up — not how often or how loudly.

We call this the Trust Network. It’s a lightweight system designed for high-signal, low-noise connection. Every channel, feature, and interaction has been carefully shaped to reduce noise, avoid performance, and create space for real human momentum.

The broader goal is to connect a million dreams by 2030. That’s what Million Dreams is about — creating the conditions for aligned people to find each other, build trust, and move forward without the pressure of algorithms, followers, or feeds.

## How to use this site

This guide introduces each of the channels inside **[our Discord space](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1380587662242611291)**. These aren’t traditional discussion channels. Instead they are tools for connecting and supporting, each designed to serve a distinct purpose.

We’ve created this to:

- Help you understand the why behind each space
- Make it easy to participate lightly but meaningfully
- Invite you to use the system in a way that supports your own journey

This site is not to teach you how to use Discord. Our focus is on helping you understand how we’re using it, so that you can make the most our of our work.

## Start with whatever feels most natural to you

You don’t need to use everything. You don’t need to be everywhere. The system is designed to work even with light participation.

If you ever feel stuck, **[let others know](/channels/i-am-stuck)** and ask for help. If someone helped you this week, **[give them a Kudos generously](/channels/give-kudos)**. Let others know **[your focus for this week](/channels/my-focus-this-week)** and spark a conversation with other like-minded members and connect on topics that are on top of your mind. You don’t have to do more than that to start showing up here.

Thanks for being here. This only works if people like you use it your way — with honesty, intent, and just enough visibility to be found when it matters.
