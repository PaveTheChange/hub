Events are one of the most natural ways for people to discover each other — not by chatting, but by showing up to something they care about.

Our events are designed to be lightweight, informal, and useful. They create opportunities for live connection without pressure or performance.

## What to Expect

We use the Events feature in Discord to schedule sessions ranging from working circles and community jams to informal co-working, conversations, and live workshops. Most of these take place in the [🛋️-hangout](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1380551959232381082) multi-media channel, although other tools like Zoom and Google Meet may get used.

Some events are hosted by the core team. Others are led by Circle members or invited guests. The goal is always the same: meaningful moments that create connection.

Joining an event doesn’t mean you have to speak, present, or stay the whole time. Come as you are, stay as long as it’s useful, and feel free to quietly observe if that’s what you need.

## Contribute an Event

Anyone can propose and host an event. If there’s something you’d like to bring to the community — a topic to explore, a working session, or just a space to think out loud — you’re welcome to offer it.

You can also share externally hosted events that may be valuable to others. If you’ve come across something worth attending — a talk, a retreat, a launch, a roundtable — create an event so others can find it easily.

## How to Stay in Sync

- Keep an eye on the Events area in Discord for upcoming sessions
- Watch the [📣-updates channel](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1380587662242611291) for announcements, highlights and recaps
- Follow any [Circles](/channels/join-circles) that interest you — they may run their own events too

You don’t have to attend live to benefit. Many events are followed by short recaps or become reference points for future conversations.

This is not about attending everything. It’s about surfacing the right moments at the right time, so the network continues to feel alive, even when you participate fractionally. Tune in to build deeper connections with other members, leading to new possibilities.
