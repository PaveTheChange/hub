The [🛋️-hangout](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1380551959232381082) is our virtual water cooler — a space for relaxed, spontaneous conversations without an agenda.

Whether you're looking to meet someone new, bounce ideas, or just take a breather and see who’s around, Hangout is open.

## What It’s For

Unlike scheduled calls or formal events, Hangout is designed for serendipity. It’s where you might drop in and find a familiar face or meet someone you’ve never spoken to before.

It’s especially useful for people who prefer informal networking. You don’t need a topic or a reason — just curiosity.

## How It Works

- Drop into the voice/video room whenever you're free
- If you're the first one there, feel free to stay for a bit — someone may spot you and join
- If no one turns up, no problem — it’s a low-commitment way to be open to conversation
- If you prefer structure, you can [create an event](/channels/events) to let others know when you’ll be around
- Conversations can be 1-1 or group — others are welcome to huddle in and join ongoing discussions

## A Smarter Kind of Networking

Traditional speed networking can feel forced. This isn’t that. Hangout is built around ease and presence. It’s a way to connect without pressure, while doing other things or just taking a moment away from your usual flow.

Some of the best ideas and connections emerge from unplanned interactions. This is a space that makes those possible.

So if you’ve got a few minutes and an open mind, swing by. You never know who you might meet.
