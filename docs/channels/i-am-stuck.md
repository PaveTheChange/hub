title: I Am Stuck
---

The [🤯-i-am-stuck](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1381524668682338405) space exists for when you hit a wall — technical, creative, strategic, or otherwise.

It’s a simple mechanism to surface stuck points so others can help, without needing long context or formal asks.

## What It’s For

We all get stuck. Sometimes it’s a problem we don’t know how to solve. Other times it’s something that just needs talking out loud. This channel is a place to say so.

Sharing that you’re stuck is not a weakness. It’s a strength. It signals honesty, momentum, and a willingness to move through challenge. More often than not, someone else has been there — and is happy to help. By sharing your problem, you create an opportunity for others to give back.

## How to Use It

- Start a new post with a short description of what you’re stuck on
- Keep it clear and specific — enough that others can respond usefully
- Tag your post with one of the available categories (e.g. Brainstorm, Advice, Review, Pointers, Introductions, etc.)
- Use the thread to clarify or explore — but avoid turning it into a side discussion

### Example

> “I’m struggling to articulate the core benefit of my product to first-time visitors. If anyone’s good at landing page messaging, I’d love a second look.”

## Light, but Not Lightweight

This isn’t just about solving blockers. It’s about creating a culture where support is normal and asking for help is easy.

Even if your stuck moment doesn’t get solved immediately, naming it creates visibility and sometimes leads to conversations that spark something later. Often the act of articulating your blocker is sufficient to unblock. Try it.

You don’t have to post often — but if you find yourself spinning your wheels, this might be the fastest way out.
