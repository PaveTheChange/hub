title: My Focus This Week
---

The [🎯-my-focus-this-week](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1381515168927977582) channel exists to help members be seen for what they care about — not just what they’ve already done.

Each member has a dedicated space where they can share what they’re focusing on this week. It’s a simple broadcast that can lead to support, visibility, and unexpected alignment with others.

## Why It Matters

We often underestimate how helpful it is to let others know where our attention is. By sharing what you’re working on, you’re not asking for validation — you’re opening a door to collaboration, insight, or encouragement.

Sometimes someone will offer to help. Sometimes someone will simply notice. Both are valuable. It is a great way to discover and connect with well-aligned members too.

Over time, these short weekly declarations build a subtle narrative of progress. They help others understand who you are and what you value, without requiring performance or updates.

## How It Works

- Every member gets a dedicated space within [🎯-my-focus-this-week](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1381515168927977582)
- Share a short summary of your focus for the week (1–2 lines is fine)
- Optionally include how others can support you
- Any related conversations happen in the same space

### Example

> “This week I’m refining my landing page and testing it with 5 users. Would love input if you’ve done early-stage UX.”

## Finding Your People

You can follow posts from members whose journeys resonate with yours. This makes it easy to stay connected without being overwhelmed by updates from everyone.

Active posts surface to the top, so timely efforts are more visible. It’s an easy way to discover people who are doing meaningful work — right now.

You don’t have to post every week. You don’t have to read every post. But if you use this space with intention, it quietly builds context and connection over time.
