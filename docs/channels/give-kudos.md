# Give Kudos

Kudos is our simple way to recognise the people who make this space better ‚Äî not through volume, but through presence, generosity, clarity, and care.

This isn‚Äôt about likes, popularity, or rewarding performance. Kudos is about appreciation. It‚Äôs about giving someone a moment of visibility for how they showed up.

## Why This Matters

In most networks, recognition tends to go to the loudest voice or the most visible profile. We‚Äôre trying something different here. We believe people should be recognised when others notice something real in how they act, speak, or support.

That could be for helping you directly, or just for showing a trait you value. Maybe someone brought calm to a difficult thread, offered insight in a moment of tension, or made progress quietly and without fanfare.

These small acts are often overlooked in busy networks. Here, they‚Äôre surfaced with intention.

## How It Works

Kudos is currently run through a single thread ([üéÅ-give-kudos](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1381512728727916615)), with a new one created each week. Here‚Äôs what to do:

- Post one message per Kudos
- Tag the person you‚Äôre recognising
- Say clearly what you‚Äôre appreciating ‚Äî keep it short, but specific
- Use emoji reactions to support others‚Äô posts
- No replies or discussions ‚Äî the space is for recognition only

If a message isn‚Äôt a Kudos, it will be removed to keep the signal clean.

## Looking Ahead

This is a manual system for now. Behind the scenes, we‚Äôre building a more structured recognition engine that will:

- Capture peer-to-peer recognition over time
- Help people discover others through traits and contributions
- Form the foundation for a future Trust Score system

You can help shape that system by joining the [Trust Protocol](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1381731569299099730) Circle.

But for now, this is where it starts. Quiet moments of appreciation that make people feel seen. When done well, it shifts the culture ‚Äî from status-seeking to mutual uplift.

So if someone helped you this week, or reminded you of the kind of person you want to be, say so. Publicly. Simply. Generously.
