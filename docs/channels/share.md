The [üçï-share](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1381523889946886154) channel is a place to surface useful information that others in the network might benefit from ‚Äî and to spark the kinds of deeper conversations and connections that start with curiosity.

Whether it‚Äôs a tool, an opportunity, or an idea that resonated with you, sharing it here builds a collective knowledge base and helps the network stay relevant and resourceful.

## What to Share

The content shared here can be practical, inspirational, or thought-provoking. It doesn‚Äôt have to be something you created ‚Äî just something you came across and thought might be useful for others.

Use the appropriate tag when posting so others can easily find what‚Äôs most relevant to them. Some of the categories include:

- **Event** ‚Äì an upcoming gathering, workshop, or talk others might benefit from (although using [Events](/channels/events) is better)
- **Tool** ‚Äì anything that makes work, collaboration, or creativity easier
- **Book** ‚Äì something worth reading or referring back to
- **Report** ‚Äì new research, frameworks, or insights
- **Podcast / Video** ‚Äì content that educates, inspires, or provokes fresh thinking
- **Community** ‚Äì other networks, forums, or platforms aligned with our values
- **Job Opportunity / Fellowship / Funding** ‚Äì openings or resources that could support someone‚Äôs journey
- **Miscellaneous** ‚Äì anything useful that doesn‚Äôt yet fit the above (we review this regularly to improve tagging)

## How to Participate

- Start a new post with a brief intro to what you‚Äôre sharing and why it‚Äôs relevant
- Add the appropriate tag
- Keep the description short, but consider adding context or a personal insight
- Others can react with emojis or add comments if they want to explore the topic further

This isn‚Äôt meant to be a high-chatter space. Some posts will start conversations, others will quietly inform. Both are valuable.

## A Shared Pool of Signal

Over time, this channel becomes a curated feed of what the network values ‚Äî and a reflection of the topics that matter most.

It's a way to stay informed without scrolling endlessly, and a way to contribute without pressure. Whether you're looking for new thinking or looking to offer it, this is a good place to start.
