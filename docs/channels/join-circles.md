title: Join Circles
---

Circles are the foundation of how meaningful relationships, collaboration, and discovery take shape in this space.

Rather than relying on constant chatter or passive feeds, we use Circles to create purposeful spaces where members can connect with relevance, act together, and grow their networks with intention.

## Two Kinds of Circles

We support two distinct types of Circles:

- **Action Circles**: Small, focused groups of up to 10 members. These exist to collaborate on short-term projects, think tanks, or longer-term ventures. They are designed to help you move ideas forward without noise or friction.

- **Networking Circles**: Larger groups, up to 150 members, built around shared interests or goals. These provide a space for shameless networking ‚Äî connecting with others who are intentionally aligned and open to exploring synergies.

We believe in shameless networking. When done with integrity, it‚Äôs one of the most valuable tools for progress. Circles make it easier to do this with structure and consent.

## Staying in the Loop, Even When You're Not Inside

Each Circle shares regular updates in the [üåê-join-circles](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1381729739592437870) channel. This allows members who aren‚Äôt part of the group to stay informed and supportive without having to participate actively. It‚Äôs a simple way to follow the story of a Circle and step in when you‚Äôre ready or available.

## The Role of Circle Leads

Every Circle has a Lead who holds responsibility for keeping the group coherent and moving. For action-focused Circles, the Lead may take on a stronger role ‚Äî especially in Venture Circles, where they are empowered to make decisions on behalf of the group to avoid stagnation.

Leads can also choose to build a small support group around them to help with facilitation and reduce pressure. The tone and pace of the Circle is shaped by the Lead‚Äôs intent, and the clarity of that leadership helps the group avoid endless discussion and stay focused on action.

## How to Join a Circle

If you see a Circle that interests you, reach out to the Circle Lead directly (you‚Äôll find their name in the overview). These conversations usually happen 1-on-1 via DMs or short calls. Especially in action circles, Leads will often evaluate your interest carefully to make sure there‚Äôs alignment ‚Äî both for your sake and the group‚Äôs.

To avoid distraction, you‚Äôll only see Circles you‚Äôre a part of in your sidebar. This helps keep the experience clean and focused.

## Want to Start a Circle?

Starting a Circle is easy. Start a message to [PaveTheChange.org on Discord](https://discord.com/users/1168060984225702063) with your idea. If it‚Äôs a good fit, we‚Äôll set it up for you ‚Äî as long as you‚Äôre happy to step into the role of Circle Lead. That‚Äôs our one requirement. A Circle needs someone who will hold the space and guide its rhythm.

This is a system designed to give you leverage, not load. Use it when the moment calls for it, and leave it behind when it doesn‚Äôt.
