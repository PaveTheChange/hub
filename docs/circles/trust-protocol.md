title: Trust Protocol Circle
---

The [üõ°Ô∏è-trust-protocol](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1380889156758143056) is where we co-create the future of recognition and connection in this network.

It‚Äôs a space for members who want to go deeper ‚Äî shaping the systems behind how we notice, appreciate, and elevate one another, and laying the groundwork for a more meaningful kind of online reputation.

## Why This Circle Exists

Most digital spaces reward attention, not contribution. We‚Äôre building something different ‚Äî a system that helps surface who‚Äôs showing up with generosity, thoughtfulness, and action. But designing that system well requires the same qualities.

That‚Äôs why this Circle exists: to bring together people who want to help us:

- Design and test the recognition system (Kudos, Trust Score, etc.)
- Ensure the system is human-first, low-noise, and built for long-term trust
- Explore cultural and technical implications of what we‚Äôre building
- Pilot early versions, reflect on the experience, and refine as we go

## What Participation Looks Like

You don‚Äôt need to be a designer or engineer to contribute ‚Äî just thoughtful, curious, and committed to creating something better.

As a member of this Circle, you might:

- Join periodic working sessions
- Contribute ideas, critiques, or stories from other networks
- Help test new features and provide feedback
- Support others in applying the system meaningfully

## How to Join

Send a message to the Circle Lead and express your interest. It will usually follow a quick chat to align on intent and fit. This helps keep the group focused and productive.

Whether you're here to shape the tech, refine the culture, or just be part of something early and important ‚Äî we welcome you.

Let‚Äôs build something that truly earns trust.
