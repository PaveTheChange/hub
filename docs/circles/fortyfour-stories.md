# 44 Stories Circle

The [ðŸ“—-44-stories](https://discord.com/channels/1380551491269558402/1380888925341483039) Circle is a collaborative publishing initiative focused on sharing real, lived experiences with mental health â€” stories from people who have faced struggles and found a way through.

By giving voice to these stories, we aim to help those currently suffering and contribute to normalising a topic that still carries too much silence and stigma.

## What Weâ€™re Building

This is an **action Circle** with a clear and powerful outcome: a published book of 44 stories. Each story will be co-created, carefully held, and shared with purpose.

Participants in the Circle actively contribute to the development of this project. That could mean sharing your own story, helping shape someone elseâ€™s, supporting editorial work, or contributing to the publishing and outreach process.

You donâ€™t need to give all your time â€” just a steady, fractional commitment and the willingness to support a shared goal.

## Why It Matters

Mental health challenges are part of many peopleâ€™s journeys â€” but the silence around them creates unnecessary isolation. By telling these stories together, weâ€™re making space for understanding, hope, and solidarity.

This is storytelling with a purpose. And if you're here, you might have something important to bring to it.
